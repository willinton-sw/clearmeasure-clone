# Architecture Patterns Reference

A catalog of 51 architectural patterns and design concepts demonstrated in this codebase, annotated with authoritative reference URLs suitable for student learning.

---

## Domain & Application Architecture

### 1. Onion Architecture
Layered architecture where dependencies point inward. Inner layers define interfaces; outer layers implement them. Core has zero outward dependencies.
- **Reference:** [Jeffrey Palermo — The Onion Architecture, Part 1 (2008)](https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/)

### 2. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Separates read models (queries) from write models (commands), allowing each to be optimized independently.
- **Reference:** [Martin Fowler — CQRS](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html)

### 3. Mediator Pattern
A behavioral design pattern where a mediator object encapsulates how objects interact, promoting loose coupling. Implemented here via the MediatR library.
- **Reference:** [Refactoring Guru — Mediator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator)

### 4. Domain Model
An object model of the business domain that incorporates both behavior and data. Business logic lives inside the domain objects themselves.
- **Reference:** [Martin Fowler — Domain Model (P of EAA)](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/domainModel.html)

### 5. Layer Supertype (Entity Base Class)
An abstract base class that provides common behavior (identity, equality) for all domain entities in a layer.
- **Reference:** [Martin Fowler — Layer Supertype (P of EAA)](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/layerSupertype.html)

### 6. Value Object
An immutable object defined entirely by its attributes rather than a unique identity. Two value objects with the same attributes are considered equal.
- **Reference:** [Martin Fowler — Value Object](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html)

### 7. Enumeration Class (Smart Enum)
Replaces primitive `enum` types with full classes that carry behavior, enabling richer domain modeling and avoiding primitive obsession.
- **Reference:** [Microsoft — Enumeration Classes over Enum Types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/enumeration-classes-over-enum-types)

### 8. State Machine Pattern
Objects transition through a set of defined states via validated transitions, preventing invalid state changes.
- **Reference:** [Refactoring Guru — State Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state)

### 9. Repository Pattern
Abstracts data access behind a collection-like interface, decoupling the domain from persistence technology. Implemented implicitly via EF Core's `DbContext`.
- **Reference:** [Martin Fowler — Repository (P of EAA)](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html)

### 10. Unit of Work
Tracks all changes made during a business transaction and commits them as a single atomic operation. Implemented implicitly via EF Core's `SaveChanges`.
- **Reference:** [Martin Fowler — Unit of Work (P of EAA)](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html)

---

## Dependency Management & Wiring

### 11. Dependency Injection / Inversion of Control
Components declare their dependencies through constructor parameters; an external container resolves and provides them at runtime.
- **Reference:** [Martin Fowler — Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection Pattern](https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html)

### 12. Service Registry
A well-known object that other objects use to find common services. Centralized registration of services in a single registry class.
- **Reference:** [Martin Fowler — Registry (P of EAA)](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/registry.html)

### 13. Convention over Configuration
The framework automatically discovers and registers services by scanning assemblies, reducing explicit configuration in favor of naming and structural conventions.
- **Reference:** [Wikipedia — Convention over Configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)

---

## UI & Presentation Architecture

### 14. Blazor WebAssembly (Client-Side SPA)

- **Reference:** [Microsoft Learn — ASP.NET Core Blazor Hosting Models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models)

### 15. Server-Side Rendering with Client Hydration
Initial rendering occurs on the server for fast first paint; the client-side framework then takes over for interactivity.
- **Reference:** [Microsoft Learn — ASP.NET Core Blazor Render Modes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/render-modes)

### 16. Backend for Frontend (BFF)
A dedicated API layer tailored to the needs of a specific frontend, rather than a generic API serving all consumers.
- **Reference:** [Azure Architecture Center — Backends for Frontends Pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/backends-for-frontends)

### 17. Shared Kernel
A shared set of types and interfaces used across bounded contexts or UI boundaries, maintained as a single shared project.
- **Reference:** [Wikipedia — Domain-Driven Design (Shared Kernel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)
