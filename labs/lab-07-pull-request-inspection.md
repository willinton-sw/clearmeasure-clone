## Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Changes

Ensure all code changes from prior labs are on a feature branch. Run:

```powershell
.\PrivateBuild.ps1
dotnet format style src/ChurchBulletin.sln --verify-no-changes
```

### Step 2: Review the PR Template

Open `.github/pull_request_template.md`. Check each item against your changes.

### Step 3: Create the Pull Request

Push your branch and create a PR with a proper description.

### Step 4: Peer Review Exercise

Swap PRs with a partner. Review using `.github/copilot-code-review-instructions.md`:

| Check | Pass/Fail |
|-------|-----------|
| No new NuGet packages | |
| Uses Shouldly (not FluentAssertions) | |
| Test doubles prefixed with `Stub` | |
| Onion Architecture respected | |
| No secrets or credentials | |

### Step 5: Leave Review Comments

At least 1 positive comment, 1 constructive suggestion, and 1 question.

### Step 6: Address Feedback

Review comments on your own PR and push fixes.
