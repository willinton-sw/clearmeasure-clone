# Lab 15: Open Code with Claude Opus - Driving a Feature to Pull Request

**Curriculum Section:** Section 08 (AI-Driven Development)
**Estimated Time:** 50 minutes
**Type:** Build + Experiment

---

## Objective

Use Claude Code (or equivalent AI coding agent) to drive a complete feature from specification to pull request, observing how the agent navigates architecture constraints, writes tests, and follows project conventions.

---

## Context

"Open code" means working with an AI coding agent in a collaborative, conversational mode — giving it a feature specification and watching it plan, implement, test, and deliver. The agent reads `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for project conventions, explores the codebase, and executes the full development workflow.

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Review the Guardrail Files

Before engaging the AI agent, review what it will read:
- `CLAUDE.md` — Architecture rules, build commands, testing conventions, dependency constraints
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — Copilot-specific rules (same principles)
- `.github/copilot-code-review-instructions.md` — What the PR review will check

### Step 2: Define the Feature

Give the AI agent this specification:

> Add a `RoomNumber` validation rule to the `WorkOrder` domain model. Room numbers must be non-empty when transitioning from Draft to Assigned (the `DraftToAssignedCommand`). If a work order has no room number, the assign command should be invalid.
>
> Requirements:
> - Add the room number validation to `DraftToAssignedCommand.UserCanExecute()` (do not modify `IsValid()` on `StateCommandBase` — it is not virtual)
> - Add unit tests covering: valid with room number, invalid without room number
> - Add an integration test that verifies the handler rejects assignment without a room number
> - Run PrivateBuild.ps1 to confirm all tests pass
> - Create a feature branch and commit

### Step 3: Observe the Agent's Approach

Watch how the agent:
1. **Explores** — reads existing command files, tests, and patterns
2. **Plans** — identifies which files to modify
3. **Implements** — writes code following discovered conventions
4. **Tests** — creates tests matching the naming pattern
5. **Validates** — runs the build to confirm green
6. **Commits** — creates a branch and commit

### Step 4: Evaluate the Output

Check the agent's work against the project standards:

| Criterion | Pass/Fail |
|-----------|-----------|
| Modification stays within Core layer (no DataAccess changes for validation) | |
| Unit tests use Shouldly assertions | |
| Test naming follows `[Method]_[Scenario]_[Result]` convention | |
| No new NuGet packages added | |
| Integration test uses `DatabaseTests().Clean()` pattern | |
| `PrivateBuild.ps1` passes | |
| Commit message is clear and descriptive | |

### Step 5: Review the PR

If the agent created a PR, review it using the same criteria from Lab 07 (Pull Request as Formal Inspection).

### Step 6: Iterate

If the agent made mistakes:
1. Give it feedback referencing the specific convention violated
2. Watch how it corrects itself
3. Note whether the correction follows the right pattern

### Step 7: Compare Approaches

**Time yourself** on two approaches:
1. How long did the AI agent take (including your review time)?
2. Estimate how long the same feature would take manually

---

## Expected Outcome

- A complete feature implemented by an AI agent
- All quality gates passing
- Understanding of when AI coding is faster vs. slower than manual coding
