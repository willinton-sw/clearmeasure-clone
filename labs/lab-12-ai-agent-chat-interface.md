# Lab 12: AI Agent Chat Interface to Control the Application

**Curriculum Section:** Section 08 (AI-Driven Development - MCP & AI Agents)
**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes
**Type:** Analyze + Build

---

## Objective

Explore how an AI agent can control the entire application through conversational prompts — creating work orders, assigning them, and managing the full lifecycle — using the MCP server and Application Chat interface.

---

## Context

While Lab 11 covers AI chat scoped to a single work order, this lab explores the **Application Chat** — a general-purpose AI assistant that can execute any operation. Combined with the MCP server, an external AI agent can manage the full work order lifecycle through natural language.

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Study the Application Chat Handler

Open `src/LlmGateway/ApplicationChatHandler.cs`:

```csharp
public class ApplicationChatHandler(ChatClientFactory factory, IToolProvider toolProvider)
    : IRequestHandler<ApplicationChatQuery, ChatResponse>
```

Key differences from `WorkOrderChatHandler`:
- Uses `IToolProvider.GetTools()` — **all** MCP tools, not just two
- Maintains chat history across the conversation
- Knows the currently logged-in user
- System prompt is general-purpose: "helpful AI assistant for a work order management application"

### Step 2: Study the Tool Provider

Open `src/McpServer/ToolProvider.cs`. This wraps all MCP tools as `AITool` instances:

- `ListWorkOrders(status?)` — filter by status
- `GetWorkOrder(workOrderNumber)` — full details
- `CreateWorkOrder(title, description, creatorUsername, roomNumber?)` — create draft
- `ExecuteWorkOrderCommand(workOrderNumber, commandName, executingUsername, assigneeUsername?)` — state transitions
- `UpdateWorkOrderDescription(workOrderNumber, newDescription, updatingUsername)` — edit
- `ListEmployees()` — all staff
- `GetEmployee(username)` — single employee

### Step 3: Study the Application Chat Page

Open `src/UI.Shared/Pages/ApplicationChat.razor`. Trace how:
- Chat history is maintained in a list
- Each message is sent with full conversation context
- The AI can execute multi-step operations (create + assign in one conversation)

### Step 4: Study the MCP Conversation Test

Open `src/AcceptanceTests/McpServer/McpChatConversationTests.cs`. This test proves an AI agent can execute a multi-step workflow from a single natural language prompt:

```csharp
var response = await _helper!.SendPrompt(
    "I am Timothy Lovejoy (my username is tlovejoy). " +
    "Create a new work order assigned to Groundskeeper Willie (username gwillie) " +
    "to cut the grass...");
```

The test then verifies the work order was actually created and assigned in the database. The AI agent:
1. Parsed the natural language request
2. Called `create-work-order` with extracted parameters
3. Took the returned work order number
4. Called `execute-work-order-command` with `DraftToAssignedCommand`
5. Reported the results

### Step 5: Study the MCP Lifecycle Test

Open `src/AcceptanceTests/McpServer/McpWorkOrderLifecycleTests.cs`. This test exercises the full lifecycle via direct MCP tool calls (without LLM):

```csharp
var createResult = await _helper!.CallToolDirectly("create-work-order", ...);
var assignResult = await _helper!.CallToolDirectly("execute-work-order-command", ...);
var beginResult = await _helper!.CallToolDirectly("execute-work-order-command", ...);
var completeResult = await _helper!.CallToolDirectly("execute-work-order-command", ...);
```

Compare this to the Playwright acceptance test from Lab 08 — same workflow, different entry point.

### Step 6: Study the MCP Test Helper

Open `src/AcceptanceTests/McpServer/McpTestHelper.cs`. Understand:
- `ConnectAsync()` — connects to the MCP HTTP endpoint at `/mcp`
- `CallToolDirectly(name, args)` — invokes a tool without LLM
- `SendPrompt(prompt)` — sends a prompt to the LLM with all MCP tools available
- Tools are discovered dynamically via `ListToolsAsync()`

### Step 7: Compare Three Entry Points

The same Draft → Assigned → InProgress → Complete workflow can be driven through:

| Entry Point | Test File | Uses Browser? | Uses LLM? |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Blazor UI | `WorkOrderFullLifecycleTests.cs` | Yes | No |
| MCP Direct | `McpWorkOrderLifecycleTests.cs` | No | No |
| MCP + LLM | `McpChatConversationTests.cs` | No | Yes |

All three exercise the **same** `IBus.Send()` → MediatR → Handler → Database pipeline.

## Expected Outcome

- Understanding of how AI agents control applications via MCP tools
- Comparison of three entry points (UI, MCP direct, MCP + LLM)
- Understanding of multi-step AI agent conversations
