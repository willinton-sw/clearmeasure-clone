# Lab 06: Tracer Bullet Transactions - Proving Distributed Messaging

**Curriculum Section:** Section 05-06 (Team/Process Design / Operate-Execute)
**Estimated Time:** 40 minutes
**Type:** Analyze + Build

---

## Objective

Understand the tracer bullet pattern for proving end-to-end messaging through NServiceBus. A tracer bullet is the simplest possible transaction that traverses the full distributed pipeline, proving the infrastructure works before building features on top of it.

---

## Context

The application uses NServiceBus with SQL Server Transport for asynchronous messaging between the UI Server and the Worker process. A **tracer bullet** is a minimal message that proves the full Send/Reply pipeline works — like firing a tracer round to see where the bullet goes before loading live ammunition.

```
Test Endpoint --Send(TracerBulletCommand)--> SQL Transport --> Worker Endpoint
Worker Endpoint --Reply(TracerBulletReplyMessage)--> SQL Transport --> Test Endpoint
```

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Read the Tracer Bullet Command

Open `src/Core/Model/Messages/TracerBulletCommand.cs`:

```csharp
public record TracerBulletCommand(Guid CorrelationId);
```

This is the simplest possible message — just a correlation ID. No business logic, no side effects. Its only purpose is to prove the pipeline works.

### Step 2: Read the Worker Handler

Open `src/Worker/Handlers/TracerBulletHandler.cs`:

```csharp
public async Task Handle(TracerBulletCommand message, IMessageHandlerContext context)
{
    _logger.LogInformation("TracerBullet received: {CorrelationId}. Sending reply.", message.CorrelationId);
    await context.Reply(new TracerBulletReplyMessage(message.CorrelationId));
}
```

The handler logs receipt and replies — nothing else. It proves the Worker endpoint is alive and processing messages.

### Step 3: Read the Signal Mechanism

Open `src/IntegrationTests/TracerBulletSignal.cs`. Study the `ConcurrentDictionary<Guid, TaskCompletionSource<bool>>` pattern:

- `WaitForReply(correlationId, timeout)` — registers a signal and blocks until completed or timed out
- `Complete(correlationId)` — called by the reply handler when the reply arrives

This is a thread-safe coordination mechanism for asynchronous messaging tests.

### Step 4: Read the Reply Handler

Open `src/IntegrationTests/Handlers/TracerBulletReplyHandler.cs`. It calls `TracerBulletSignal.Complete(correlationId)` to unblock the waiting test.

### Step 5: Study the Acceptance Test

Open `src/AcceptanceTests/NServiceBus/TracerBulletTests.cs`:

```csharp
[Test]
public async Task TracerBullet_WorkerReceivesCommandAndReplies()
{
    if (!ServerFixture.WorkerStarted)
        Assert.Ignore("Worker is not running (requires SqlServerTransport).");

    var correlationId = Guid.NewGuid();
    var messageSession = TestHost.GetRequiredService<IMessageSession>(newScope: false);
    var replyTask = TracerBulletSignal.WaitForReply(correlationId, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60));

    await messageSession.Send(new TracerBulletCommand(correlationId));
    await replyTask;
}
```

Key patterns:
- `RequiresBrowser => false` — no browser needed for messaging tests
- Skips gracefully if Worker is not running
- Registers the signal **before** sending (avoids race condition)
- Uses correlation ID to match request with reply

### Step 6: Draw the Message Flow

On paper, draw the full message flow including:
1. Test registers signal in `TracerBulletSignal`
2. Test sends `TracerBulletCommand` via `IMessageSession`
3. SQL Server Transport picks up the message
4. Worker's `TracerBulletHandler` receives and replies
5. SQL Server Transport routes reply back
6. Test's `TracerBulletReplyHandler` receives reply
7. Handler calls `TracerBulletSignal.Complete()`
8. Test's `WaitForReply` unblocks — test passes

### Step 7: Think About New Tracer Bullets

**Design exercise:** If the application added a new messaging endpoint (e.g., a Notification Service), what would its tracer bullet look like?

- What new command/reply records would you create?
- Where would the handler live?
- What would the acceptance test look like?

## Expected Outcome

- Understanding of the tracer bullet pattern for distributed systems
- Ability to trace the full NServiceBus Send/Reply pipeline
- Understanding of thread-safe signaling with `TaskCompletionSource`
