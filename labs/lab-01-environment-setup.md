# Lab 01: Environment Setup & First Contribution

**Curriculum Section:** Warm-up
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
**Type:** Build / Hands-on

---

## Objective

Confirm the development toolchain works end-to-end, make a first code change through the full pull request workflow, and become familiar with the build pipeline.

---

## Prerequisites

- Developer-grade Windows 11 x64 computer with full administrator account
- Unrestricted GitHub account
- Visual Studio 2026 with .NET 10.0 SDK
- JetBrains ReSharper with "IntelliJ IDEA" keymap selected
- SQL Server LocalDB (or better)

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ClearMeasureLabs/bootcamp-palermo-workorders
cd bootcamp-palermo-workorders
```

### Step 2: Run the Private Build

```powershell
.\PrivateBuild.ps1
```

This executes the full local build: compile, unit tests, database migration, and integration tests. Verify all tests pass with a green result.

> **If the build fails:** Check that SQL Server LocalDB is installed and running. The build auto-detects the database engine (LocalDB on Windows, Docker SQL on Linux, SQLite fallback).

### Step 3: Explore the Build Script

Open `build.ps1` in your editor. Identify these key functions:

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `Init` | Clean and restore NuGet packages |
| `Compile` | Build solution with warnings-as-errors |
| `UnitTests` | Run unit tests with code coverage |
| `IntegrationTest` | Run integration tests against a real database |
| `Package-Everything` | Create deployment packages |

**Question to answer:** What is the database engine detection logic? (Hint: look for `Setup-DatabaseForBuild`)

### Step 4: Open the Solution

Open `src/ChurchBulletin.sln` in Visual Studio. Explore the Solution Explorer:

- **Core** — Domain models, interfaces, queries (zero project references)
- **DataAccess** — EF Core context, MediatR handlers (references Core only)
- **UI/Server, UI/Client, UI.Shared, UI/Api** — Blazor WebAssembly + Server UI
- **Database** — DbUp migration scripts
- **UnitTests, IntegrationTests, AcceptanceTests** — Test projects

### Step 5: Add Yourself to ZDataLoader

Open `src/IntegrationTests/ZDataLoader.cs`. Find the placeholder comments (`//Person 1` through `//Person 13`).

Add yourself as a new Employee following the `jpalermo` pattern (lines 24-28):

```csharp
//Person 1
var yourName = new Employee("yourusername", "YourFirst", "YourLast", "you@email.com");
yourName.AddRole(lead);
yourName.AddRole(fulfillment);
db.Add(yourName);
```

### Step 6: Verify the Build Still Passes

```powershell
.\PrivateBuild.ps1
```

### Step 7: Run the Application

```powershell
cd src/UI/Server
dotnet run
```

Navigate to `https://localhost:7174`. Verify your name appears in the login dropdown. Check health at `https://localhost:7174/_healthcheck`.

### Step 8: Submit a Pull Request

```powershell
git checkout -b yourusername/add-myself-to-dataloader
git add src/IntegrationTests/ZDataLoader.cs
git commit -m "Add [YourName] to ZDataLoader"
git push -u origin yourusername/add-myself-to-dataloader
```

Create a pull request on GitHub using the template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.

---

## Expected Outcome

- Green build on `PrivateBuild.ps1`
- Your name visible in the application login dropdown
- An open pull request on GitHub
